\section{Block Allocator}

The GHC runtime system allocates \textbf{mega blocks}. These are large blocks which are then divided into blocks. Each block forms a linked list of blocks. Note: all meta deata (i.e. block descriptors) are stored at the beginning of the Mega block, so they can be easily looked up.
